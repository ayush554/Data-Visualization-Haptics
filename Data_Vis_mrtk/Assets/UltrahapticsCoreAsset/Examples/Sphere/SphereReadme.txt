Sphere Example
--------------

The Sphere example demonstrates the use of a custom Block 'Sphere' - reach out and touch the moon!

The 'Sphere' Block is an encapsulated haptic effect which dynamically calculates
the intersection of the hand plane with a virtual sphere.

You can experiment with different sized/positions Spheres by changing the radius and centre of the Sphere.

Sphere is implemented purely in Python Blocks and requires the following Blocks included
in the Streaming Assets folder:

Sphere.py
NearestPointOnPlane.py
NonParallelVector.py
RightTriangleSideLength.py
VectorOperations.py
