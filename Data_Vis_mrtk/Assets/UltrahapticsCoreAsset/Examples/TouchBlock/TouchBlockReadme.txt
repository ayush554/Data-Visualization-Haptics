TouchBlock Example
---------------------------

The TouchBlock example demonstrates how to animate a Sensation's position via other GameObjects.

In the example, the HapticCube's Transform is linked to the Transform of a 'Square' Sensation,
whose size has be chosen to match the size of the virtual cube.

The position and scale of the Haptic Cube drives the Transform field of the Sensation Source.
